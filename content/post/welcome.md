As a developper, I like to code, not a surprise. I don't like so much writing documentation but overall I hate to do something I have already done. And specially if it's to fix a bug I have already encountered.
So if I can't remember how I have fixed it, it's worse.

So I have deceded to do a blog, just to share my experience, my problems and how I have fixed its.

At least, for me, it's a way to solve a problem ... Getting old I lost my memories ;)

So welcome to this blog, I hope you will enjoy it as much as I have enjoyed writing it.
